### Timezone Web App
This app will be a web application that can grab the userâ€™s current location (to tell what timezone they are in). The user will be greeted with a grid of their selected timezones. By default their current timezone will be the first one, but the user should have an option to add
more timezones depending on area to their list.<br> 

The dashboard of timezones should include the current weather and any breaking news within that timezone. Finally, the user should be able to share these timezones with friends.
